## Usage Instructions:

1. **Select Indicators and Patterns**: Choose your preferred indicators and patterns for analysis.
2. **Trigger Generate Strategy**: Click the "Generate Strategy" icon in the top right corner of the stock chart.
3. **Adjust Analysis Section**: Movable "Start" and "End" bars will appear on the stock chart. Adjust these bars to modify the analyzed section.
4. **Add Key Points**: Within the set range, a "Key Point" marker appears on each candle bar as the mouse moves. Click to add a Key Point, and use the cross icon to remove it. Key Points outside the adjusted range turn red and are automatically removed when the user stops dragging the bar.
5. **Start Generate**: Click "Start Generate" to open a pop-up window with multiple strategies and descriptions. Users can choose "Reset Conditions" to go back to the previous steps or "More Strategies" for new options. Closing the pop-up will stop these strategies from showing in the New Strategy interface. The same content will be displayed next time until the conditions are reset from the beginning steps.
