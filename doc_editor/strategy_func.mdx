### Introduction

Stock strategy functions involve defining specific rules and criteria for buying or selling securities based on various technical or fundamental factors. These functions guide traders in making informed decisions, setting entry and exit points, and managing risk within their investment approach. Ultimately, stock strategy functions aim to optimize trading performance and achieve financial objectives in the dynamic and unpredictable stock market.


## Get Data


The "Get Data" function retrieves historical pricing information for a specific stock, offering a chronological record of its past market performance. This data includes opening and closing prices, high and low values, trading volumes, and other relevant metrics, enabling users to analyze trends, make informed investment decisions, and conduct thorough market research.
