### Introduction

Stock strategy functions involve defining specific rules and criteria for buying or selling securities based on various technical or fundamental factors. These functions guide investors in making informed decisions, setting entry and exit points, and managing risk within their investment approach. Ultimately, stock strategy functions aim to optimize trading performance and achieve financial objectives in the dynamic and unpredictable stock market.

## Start
The Start function serves as the designated entry for users initiating the process of strategy creation and backtesting. It offers a quick and convenient way to set default frequencies and add new data effortlessly using the New Data button, streamlining the start of the strategy development journey with efficiency.<br />

**Defualt Frequency**<br />
The default frequency in the “Start” component refers to a predefined frequency, such as 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, or daily. By setting the default frequency, the frequency value in the “New Data” feature and subsequent functions would automatically synchronize with the preset default frequency.
