Pattern recognition functions are commonly used in technical analysis to identify trends and potential trading opportunities. 
These functions analyze historical price data and search for patterns that may indicate a future price movement. 
Common patterns include head and shoulders, triangles, and double tops. 
QuantBe currently offers support for 18 of the most common stock chart patterns, 
and those tools can assist investors in making more informed trading decisions and potentially increase their profits.
