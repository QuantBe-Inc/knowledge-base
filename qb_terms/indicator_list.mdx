Stock technical indicators are mathematical calculations that help traders analyze past market trends and predict future movements in the stock price. 
Technical indicators are classified into different categories based on their functionality. 
The following sections provide an explanation for each category and examples of the functions in each category.

## Overlap Studies

Overlap studies are technical indicators that use price data to determine potential levels of support and resistance. 
These studies are used to identify price trends and potential turning points in the market.

- #### Bollinger Bands
    
    Bollinger Bands are a type of statistical chart characterizing the prices and volatility over time of a financial instrument or commodity, 
    using a formulaic method propounded by John Bollinger in the 1980s.
