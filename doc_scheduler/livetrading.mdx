##  Live Trading
Dive into real-time trading with Live Trading.  Just like setting an alarm, this feature schedules trading sessions for quick strategy execution.  With live data, you get detailed reports including dynamic stock charts and buy/sell signals.  Plus, easily interact with the signalsâ€”clicking them shifts the Stock Market chart to show buys in purple and sells in green.  It's user-friendly, like the watcher interface.  Select a ticker and access company overviews and news.  You can also switch to the watchlist feature effortlessly.  Experience the simplicity and power of Live Trading for informed decisions and precise execution.
